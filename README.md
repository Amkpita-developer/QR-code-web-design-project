## My process

My process when designing this project was quite simple.
I first created the necessary folder and files for the project. Which were the main root folder, followed by my index.html and main.css files.
Then I added the bootstrap CSS library to the project root folder.
After that, I opened up the project folder in my VS code in order to begin coding out the challenge.

HTML
I first started with the HTML side of things.
Inside my body element, I added a section tag, with a div container inside of it serving as the main container. Then I added a header element within that main container, with an image and another div container which served as the container for my paragraph elements. After that, I utilized bootstrap classes to centralize the main container and everything inside of it. Which included the image and the paragraphs. After this was onto my main.css file to add my custom CSS.

CSS
The CSS for the project was also straight forward.
All I did was make sure that the image was properly sized, add the necessary paddings and borders and colors for the project, then remembered to also add the custom font family asked by the project.
And that was about it.
